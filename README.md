# coffee_app

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

🚀 Excited to share my latest project! I've developed a coffee app using Flutter and Bloc state management, with Firebase as the robust backend.

📌 Key features:

☕ Four Categories: Hot Coffee, Frappe, Cold Coffee, and Juices - Offering a delightful variety of beverages for coffee aficionados and juice lovers.

💾 Cloud Firestore Integration - Seamlessly store and retrieve menu items and user preferences in real-time.

🛒 Seamless Checkout - Effortlessly place orders and make payments for a hassle-free experience.
