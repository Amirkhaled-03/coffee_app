# coffee_app

A new Flutter project.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! I've developed a coffee app using #Flutter and advanced Bloc state management, with Firebase as the robust backend.

ðŸ“Œ Key features:

â˜• Four Categories: Hot Coffee, Frappe, Cold Coffee, and Juices - Offering a delightful variety of beverages for coffee aficionados and juice lovers.

ðŸ’¾ Cloud Firestore Integration - Seamlessly store and retrieve menu items and user preferences in real-time.

ðŸ›’ Seamless Checkout - Effortlessly place orders and make payments for a hassle-free experience.
